# HospitalAppointments

Created a Java application that uses Gradle to build the project and PostgreSQL to store data.

The application allows scheduling a doctor's consultation.

When the application starts, a new window appears for each doctor saved in the database showing their future consultations:

Also, another window opens for the making of appointments:

After selecting the desired department, a window that shows all of the doctors working in the chosen department and the form for the appointment will appear:

After selecting a doctor and completing the form and pressing “ make appointment “ a new appointment will be made, if it does not overlap with another.

From this window you can also access all of the appointments for the selected doctor by pressing “show appointments” and cancel any of them:
